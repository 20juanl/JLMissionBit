<p>You buy a plane ticket to Hawaii in 5 hours.</p>

<p>You enjoy your life at Hawaii. You ride dolphins for a living and earn money gambling. After 5 years you decide to move back to your home in San Francisco.  </p>

<p>When you get to San Francisco you call everyone in your family, but no one responded. Then you call the police and ask what happened. They say that 5 years ago, the day after you left, someone broke in to each of your family member's houses, slaugthered them, and left no trace or the family's contacts. You spend the rest of your life being a no-life with your face on a T.V or computer screen every day. You regret your choise, but you find happiness still being alive.</p>
