<head> <title> KILL HIM</title>
	<h1>You chose to kill your target</h1>
</head>
<p>You find your target's hideout and sneak in. You sneak into your target's office with a sword that you found in the streets.</p>

<p>You swing the sword at your target's head but nothing happened, then you realize that was a hologram and that you've been trapped. You turn a round and see a man holding a gun to your head. You swing your sword at him but he jumps over it with super-human powers and shoots you.</p>

<p>You wake up and hear beautiful singing. Then you see angels looking at you. You have died. Suddenly the angels turn into demons. You have died and went to hell.  </p>
