<h1>Random Title</h1>

<p>This is my first HTML and the first time I took a class at GHS. I got introduced to this class (Mission bit) by my math and science teacher Mr.Chinchilla. Mr.C told me the time it started and where it was hosted at, but not when. Then Ms.Hilarides told me more about Mission bit so I could decide wheter to go there or not.</p>
